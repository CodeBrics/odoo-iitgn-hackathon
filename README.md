Odoo Expense Management System

[cite\_start]This repository contains the front-end code for a web-based expense management system, developed as a solution to the problem of time-consuming, error-prone, and manual expense reimbursement processes in companies[cite: 3]. [cite\_start]The system is designed to provide a simple and transparent way to manage expenses, supporting multi-level and conditional approval workflows[cite: 5, 6].

### Problem Statement

[cite\_start]**Problem Statement Name**: Expense Management [cite: 2]

[cite\_start]Companies often struggle with manual expense reimbursement processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack transparency[cite: 3]. [cite\_start]There is no simple way to define approval flows based on thresholds, manage multi-level approvals, or support flexible approval rules[cite: 5, 6, 7].

### Key Features

  * [cite\_start]**Authentication & User Management**: The system automatically creates a new company and an admin user upon the first login or signup[cite: 11]. [cite\_start]The admin can then create and manage employees and managers [cite: 13][cite\_start], assigning them roles and defining reporting relationships[cite: 14, 15].
  * [cite\_start]**Expense Submission (Employee)**: Employees can submit new expense claims, including details like the amount, category, description, and date[cite: 18, 19]. [cite\_start]They can also view their own expense history (approved, rejected)[cite: 20].
  * [cite\_start]**Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin)**: The system supports multi-level approval flows with a defined sequence of approvers[cite: 23]. [cite\_start]An expense claim moves to the next approver's account only after the current one has approved or rejected it[cite: 32]. [cite\_start]Managers and admins can view expenses awaiting their approval and approve or reject them with comments[cite: 34, 35].
  * [cite\_start]**Conditional Approval Rules**: The platform can support various conditional approval rules, such as a percentage rule (e.g., if 60% of approvers approve, the expense is approved) or a specific approver rule (e.g., if a CFO approves, the expense is auto-approved)[cite: 39, 40]. [cite\_start]These rules can be combined to create hybrid workflows[cite: 41, 42].
  * **Roles & Permissions**: The system includes a clear permission structure for different user roles:
      * [cite\_start]**Admin**: Manages users, roles, and approval rules; views all expenses; and has the ability to override approvals[cite: 44].
      * [cite\_start]**Manager**: Can approve or reject expenses for their team, with the expense amount visible in the company's default currency[cite: 44].
      * [cite\_start]**Employee**: Submits expenses and views their own expense history and status[cite: 44].
  * [cite\_start]**Additional Features**: The application is designed to integrate with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm to automatically extract details like amount, date, and description from a scanned receipt, creating an autogenerated expense claim[cite: 46, 47].
