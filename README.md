    Key Features

      Authentication & User Management  : The system automatically creates a new company and an admin user upon the first login or signup.  The admin can then create and manage employees and managers, assigning them roles and defining reporting relationships
      Expense Submission (Employee)  : Employees can submit new expense claims, including details like the amount, category, description, and date. They can also view their own expense history (approved, rejected) .
      Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin)  : The system supports multi-level approval flows with a defined sequence of approvers.  An expense claim moves to the next approver's account only after the current one has approved or rejected it.  Managers and admins can view expenses awaiting their approval and approve or reject them with comments.
      Conditional Approval Rules  : The platform can support various conditional approval rules, such as a percentage rule (e.g., if 60% of approvers approve, the expense is approved) or a specific approver rule (e.g., if a CFO approves, the expense is auto-approved) .  These rules can be combined to create hybrid workflows.
      Roles & Permissions  : The system includes a clear permission structure for different user roles:
          Admin  : Manages users, roles, and approval rules; views all expenses; and has the ability to override approvals.
          Manager  : Can approve or reject expenses for their team, with the expense amount visible in the company's default currency.
          Employee  : Submits expenses and views their own expense history and status.
      Additional Features  : The application is designed to integrate with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) algorithm to automatically extract details like amount, date, and description from a scanned receipt, creating an autogenerated expense claim.
